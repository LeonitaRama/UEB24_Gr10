        <p align="center">The filmmakers cited the series' first installment, The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), as
            inspiration for
            the script and tone of the film, with critics describing the film as a "requel". <br> Pre-production for the
            film
            started shortly before On Stranger Tides was released in early 2011, with Terry Rossio writing the initial
            script. In early 2013, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write <br> a new script for the film, with Depp being
            involved
            in Nathanson's writing process. Initially planned for a 2015 release, the film was delayed to 2016 and then
            to 2017, due to script and budget issues. Principal photography started in Australia in February 2015, after
            the Australian government offered Disney $20 million in tax incentives, and ended in July 2015.
            Dead Men Tell No Tales premiered in Shanghai on May 11, 2017, and was released in the United States on May
            26. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $795 million worldwide against a
            production budget of $230–320 million.Thirteen years after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom,[a] a
            twelve-year-old Henry Turner boards the Flying Dutchman and informs his father, Will, that the curse which
            binds Will to the Dutchman and only permits him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the Trident
            of Poseidon. Henry intends to recruit Captain Jack Sparrow to help find it, but Will believes this is
            impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the Dutchman then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to
            find Jack and the Trident.</p>

                Development took years, with multiple screenplays and directors attached. In 1997, Sommers successfully

                footage and computer-generated imagery to create the titular monster. Jerry Goldsmith provided the
                orchestral score.

                Wonder Woman is a superhero created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen
                name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter for DC Comics. <br> Marston's wife, Elizabeth, and their
                life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's appearance.
                Wonder Woman appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. <br> The character is a founding member
                of
                the Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star Comics #8 published October 21, 1941 with
                her first feature in Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942. The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC
                Comics almost continuously ever since.
                In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira. When
                blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana
                Prince.
                Wonder Woman's origin story (from Golden to Bronze Age) relates that she was sculpted from clay by her
                mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek
                gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the biological daughter of Zeus and
                Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe.
